## Deployment

This project is ready to be deployed to any static site hosting service. Some popular options include:

* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

To deploy, typically you would run `npm run build` (or `yarn build`) which creates a `build` folder with the production-ready static assets. You then deploy the contents of this `build` folder to your chosen hosting provider. Refer to the documentation of your hosting provider for specific deployment instructions.
